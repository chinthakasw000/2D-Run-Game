        <p>It's great to hear that you are studying at the Java Institute and that you created a 2D game as part of
            your scholarship application, Chinthaka! By sharing your game with others, you are providing them with
            an opportunity to see your skills and abilities as a game developer, and it's a great way to get
            feedback and improve your game development skills.

            When inviting others to play your game, it's a good idea to provide some background information about
            the game, such as the game's concept, the programming techniques and concepts you used to create it, and
            any unique features or elements that make your game stand out. You can also provide information about
            the controls and how to play the game, so that others can quickly get started and enjoy the game.


            You can also invite feedback and suggestions from players, and use that feedback to improve your game
            development skills and your game. By doing this, you can also demonstrate your willingness to learn and
            adapt, which is an important trait to have as a game developer.

            Overall, by sharing your 2D game and inviting others to play it, you are showcasing your skills and
            abilities as a game developer and providing an opportunity for others to enjoy your game. It's also a
            great way to get feedback and improve your game development skills. Best of luck in your studies and
            future game development projects!</p>
